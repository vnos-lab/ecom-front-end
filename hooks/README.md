## Description
This folder contains hooks that are used in the project.

Each file will contain a description of what it does and how to use it.

The hooks are not automatically installed, you have to do it manually.

You can see the list of hooks in the [hooks](https://usehooks-ts.com/react-hook/use-boolean) folder.
